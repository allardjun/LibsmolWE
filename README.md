# WeSmol 

The Weighted Ensemble for spatial rare event simulations in Smoldyn. The goal of this project is to build a framework that allows weighted ensemble rare event sampling to work with a variety of Smoldyn simulations through the libSmoldyn C library. This initial version is designed specifically for 2D evacuation reaction-diffusion events.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Requires libSmoldyn

### Basic run

After compiling and linking with the libSmoldyn library, a basic run can be initiated in the command line by
```
$ ./weSmoldyn simOut.txt fluxOut.txt seedUsed.txt 0 excTime.txt
```

Explain the input parameters.

### Unit test

### Using scripts for a local run

### Using scripts for a run on hpc

On the to-do list...
