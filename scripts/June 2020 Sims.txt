Sims to be completed as of May31 2020
Dimerization:
Needs to be prepared to execute at a high density

Probabilistic reentry
Needs to be prepared to execute at a high density

Actin corrals:
All sims need to be done

Other:
Investigate boundary effects at physiological densities

Changes in the code prior to executing these sims:
Implemented savestates. Created corrals, new corrals parameters file.


Files needed to be copied for each sim:

binDefinitions.txt
binParams.txt
corralsParams.txt

WEparams.txt
ISEED

Scripts to execute for each sim:

High density dimer sweep - 
binding radii should correspond to size of the unit cell for CD45, 86x60x160 angstroms, or a 3-4nm binding radius. Our ROI radius of 1 corresponds to a length ranging from 100nm-300nm, so that corresponds to a binding radius of .03-.12. We'll use .003, .03, and .3 as our test binding radii (though we might predictably expect that .3 is large enough that the solution might be completely dimeric)

Thankfully our previous sweeps were done with binding radii at .001 and .005, so we know which unbinding rates give a complete sweep for those (10^-3 to 10^6, approximately) so we can scale those up twice to hopefully give a complete sweep for .03 and .3 as well

To execute these sims, we'll want to use "repeatedDimerCheck.sh". It's worth making sure that the split for monomeric vs dimeric starts happens at a reasonable unbinding radius. (potentially replace the bindR loop with separate loops to better split based on unbindK)

Binning should be done according to some "good enough" binning method. 1d binning

Probabilistic reentry:
reentryRateScan.sh
Dimerization should be turned off. Probability should scan from 0 to 1. Most likely want 20 runs at each p value.

Actin corrals:
Script needs to be written
Need to use a variety of sizings and probabilities. Try doing a cursory run with 3 different sizings and scan hopping rates from 0 to 1

Other:
Boundary effects
constantDensityScan.sh

Set density to physiological densities (90molecules / 9 square units of area = 10) and scan for a variety of molecules. Note that since the area of the ROI is pi and the density is 10, the number of particles you scan across should be >32 (try something like 40-150).
Bins are kind of a bitch for this. Try creating a "binDefinitions1.txt" and "binDefinitions2.txt" etc. for some cutoff point. Copy binDefinitions1.txt as binDefinitions.txt
